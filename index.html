            After the massive success of RRR, SS Rajamouli is now all set to
            embark on a new journey with his next project. Tentatively titled
            SSMB29, the film features South star Mahesh Babu in the lead role. The
            movie is currently in its pre-production phase. SS Rajamouli has
            finally begun location hunting in Kenya.The filmmaker shared a photo
            of himself from the open fields of Amboseli National Park on
            Instagram. He was seen dressed in a casual t-shirt and jeans as he
            walked against the backdrop of a dazzle of zebras. In the caption, SS
            Rajamouli wrote, “Trotting to discover…” SS Rajamouli is joined by his
            son SS Karthikeya on this journey. Karthikeya shared some pictures
            from their adventures on his Instagram Stories. We could see the
            father and son duo enjoying a jungle safari in Kenya. They also
            spotted giraffes and other animals on this trip.SS Rajamouli attended
            a special screening of RRR in Japan, where he talked about his
            upcoming film with Mahesh Babu. The ace director said, “We started my
            next film. We completed the writing. We are in the pre-production
            process. We are doing all the pre-visualisation for the film. But we
            haven't finished the casting yet. Only the main hero, the protagonist
            of the film is locked. His name is Mahesh Babu. He is a Telugu actor.”
            As the crowd erupted in cheers after hearing Mahesh Babu's name, SS
            Rajamouli added, “Looks like many of you already know him. He is very
            handsome and hopefully, we get to finish the film a little bit fast.
            During the release, I will bring him here. And I will introduce him to
            you and sure you will love him as well.”

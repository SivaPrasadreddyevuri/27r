<p>Guntur Kaaram (pronounced [ɡʊɳʈuːɾ kaːɾʌm]; transl. Spice of Guntur), also known as Guntur Kaaram: Highly Inflammable,[5] is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language action drama film[6] written and directed by Trivikram Srinivas and produced by S. Radha Krishna through Haarika & Hassine Creations. It features Mahesh Babu in the lead role, alongside Sreeleela, Meenakshi Chaudhary, Prakash Raj, Ramya Krishna, Jayaram, Jagapathi Babu, Sunil and Rao Ramesh.

    The film was officially announced in May 2021 under the tentative title SSMB28, as it is Babu's 28th film in the leading role, and the official title was announced in May 2023. Principal photography commenced in September 2022, predominantly shot in Hyderabad, and wrapped by late-December 2023. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Thaman S, with cinematography handled by Manoj Paramahamsa and editing handled by Naveen Nooli.

    Guntur Kaaram was released in theatres worldwide on 12 January 2024, coinciding with Sankranti. The film received negative reviews from critics for Trivikram's direction and screenplay, but Thaman's music and Babu's performance were praised.[7] It eventually emerged as a box office bomb.[4]</p>
